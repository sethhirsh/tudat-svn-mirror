//! Compute Lorentz force due to static magnetic field
/*!
 * Computes Lorentz force due to static magnetic field on a particle in an
 * inertial reference frame.
 * Assumes the particle is point-like.The following equation is used to calculate the force:
 * \f[
 *		\bar{f} = q * \bar{v} x \bar{B}
 * \f] 
 * where \f$f\f$ is the force on the particle, \f$q\f$ is the charge of the accelerating
 * particle, \f$\bar{v}\f$ is the velocity of the accelerating particle, and \f$\bar{B}\f$
 * is the local magnetic field. Note: This force does not take into account
 * the Coulomb force between the particle and the source.
 * \param velocityOfBodySubjectToAcceleration Velocity of body which is being accelerated
 *			by the Lorentz force.                                                             [m/s]
 * \param chargeOfBodySubjectToAcceleration Charge of body which is being accelerated by
 *			Lorentz force. 																	  [C]
 * \param localMagneticField local magnetic field at position of body subject to acceleration [TÂ·m]
 * \return Lorentz force due to static magnetic field 				                          [N]
